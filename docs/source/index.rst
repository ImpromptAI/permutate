**Permutate is an automated testing framework for LLM Plugins.**

**ChatGPT Ignited LLM Plugins**

ChatGPT spread like wildfire but it had some limitations, notably, it couldn’t access private data/systems. But this limitation was resolved with the release of OpenAI Plugins. This enabled developers to connect their favorite applications to ChatGPT. Unfortunately, in the rush to release plugins, quality assurance lacked.

From a software quality perspective, several common problems surfaced:

Despite the plugin being “installed” in a user’s environment, the plugin wasn’t consistently activated by the user’s text.
When it was activated, the plugin wasn’t called correctly, leading to undesirable results.
Ultimately, plugin developers chose to remove the bulk of their features just to get basic functions to run correctly. 🙁
